## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It's my first complete project. I learned:
- the difference between color:rgb and color:hsl.
- how to find and put the google font links into html file.
- how to use flex-grow 

### Continued development

I'm not yet comfortable with responsive design.
I don't know if I have to write "position: relative" in the "body" of css file.
I had some trouble with the image background. I don't know if it should move or not. I used a fixed height.
I need to improve my accuracy for box-shadow values (I used random values).


### Useful resources

I used developer.mozilla.org
and "Le Designer du Web" Youtube channel.
